# ABCU-DSA-Project
CS-300 Portfolio Project

## What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
The problem being solved in the project for this course involves creating a program for an advising system that can load course information from a file, store it in a data structure, and provide functionalities like printing the course list and retrieving course information.

## How did you approach the problem?
To approach the problem, I first analyzed the requirements and identified the need for an efficient data strucutre to store and manipulate the course information that was provided. I looked at three different data structures (Vectors, Hash Tables, and a Tree) and considered each of their advatages and disadvantages in terms of runtime complexity and memory usage. Eventually I came to the conclusion that the Hash Table would be the best data strucutre for this problem. (Reasons can be found in pdf)

## How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
During the activities and project, I encountered roadbloacks such as handling file input, validating data, and designing user interfaces. In order for me to overcome these challenges, I broke down the problem into smaller tasks, researched relevant concepts and techniques, and iteratively tested and debugged the code. For the coding protion of this project, the pseudocode helped a ton when it came to knowing what I should code.

## How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
Working on this project expanded my approach to designing software by putting an importance on modularity, scalability, and efficiency. I learned how to further break down complex problems into more manageable components and how to choose the appropriate data strucutre and algorithm for a problem.

## How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Overall, my perception on how to write maintainable, readable, and adaptable programs hasn't really changed. Much of what I knew about maintainablity, readablity, and adaptablity has come from previous courses which I utilized here for this project.
